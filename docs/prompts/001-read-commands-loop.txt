initial prompt which was used to generate this methods:
So, I want to implement the following:

it's a non-standard CLI app with a `bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)` reader for user's input. When user clicks the enter, we're processing the typed command.
The user's input is succeeded with '>' symbol in the terminal (but it can be really, anything, for example '#room@host> ').

I want to make it work with real-time new logs in the process.

For example, there's '> ' showing as a last line in the current terminal, waiting for a new input (command). And then the CLI app receives a new message from the server, and we want to print it to the terminal.

It should work the following way: we clear line with '>', print the log, and then print again '>' and wait for user's input.

The text in the line with '>' should be all editable, i.e. after clearing the last line, printing the incoming message, and restoring '> command param', user should be able to click the backspace and remove symbols one by one.
